# Crypto Dashboard

This is a Cryptocurrency Dashboard that is used to display Cryptocurrency data, and allow the user to add any crypto currency to a new Wish List. The users can then either share an online view of this list (If the list is public, some lists will be private), or email it to themselves. User will also need to verify their phone number before creating a wish list (They will still be able to view the dashboard data, just not create any wish lists or add currencies to them). Creating a list will require the user to enter their password to confirm their list.
